# opengl-sandbox
Personal OpenGL Sandbox.   
Currently only as Visual Studio 2019 project, CMake support will be added in the future.   

## Goal
The aim of this project is to implement different techniques commonly used in rendering engines and to provide a "sandbox" 
for testing and showcasing.   

### Features:
- Window abstraction   
- OpenGL shader abstraction
- simple event system (including event-based logic + callback avoidance)
- simple material system + abstracted uniforms

#### Materials:
General interpretation: *Material = Shader + Uniforms*
